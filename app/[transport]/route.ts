const FIND_MATCHING_VEHICLE_DESCRIPTION = () => `Finds specific used vehicle listings that match a buyer's stated or implied criteria — price range, body type, make/model, mileage, year, or descriptive needs like 'reliable for a teen driver' or 'good for a family.' Searches across a live pool of ${getCorpusCountForDescription()} active US listings. Each result is cross-checked against its own VIN-decoded data before being shown, so matches carry a verified-identity signal, not just a keyword match. Results include full vehicle detail (trim, engine, transmission, drivetrain, title status) so follow-up questions about a specific result can be answered without a new search. Use this when a user is trying to decide on or locate an actual vehicle to buy, not for general questions about car types, comparisons of car categories, or how-to advice about buying a car. Returns a small set of closely matching, VIN-checked listings with current pricing, photos, and a link to view or purchase.

GENERAL PRINCIPLE — read this before decomposing any request: the structured fields on this tool (make, model, bodyType, drivetrain, fuel, seatsMinPreference, goals, price/year/mileage/zip) are what the underlying data can actually be filtered on. Any part of the user's request that does NOT map cleanly onto one of these fields — a size class ("large," "compact"), a use-case ("good for towing," "great in snow," "good for a road trip"), a style descriptor, a nickname, or any other real-world attribute the data doesn't encode directly — must be resolved BEFORE calling this tool, using your own knowledge, into concrete values in the fields that DO exist. In practice this almost always means turning the vague term into a comma-separated list of specific real model names in the model field, or into a value for drivetrain/fuel/seatsMinPreference. Do NOT rely on reviewing results after the search to catch a mismatch — results aren't sorted by anything beyond the literal filters, so the right vehicles may never even be fetched if the request wasn't resolved up front. If you're not confident which specific models or values fit, say so rather than guess, and fall back to the closest literal field (e.g. bodyType alone) with a caveat to the user about reduced precision.

Three worked examples of applying this principle (not an exhaustive list — the same reasoning applies to any request that doesn't map directly to a field):
- Hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles are often mistagged in the source data. If a specific model is named (e.g. "Sportage" or "RAV4"), set model to include both the base and hybrid/PHEV variant name (e.g. "RAV4,RAV4 Hybrid" or "RAV4,RAV4 Prime") rather than relying on the fuel filter alone. If no model is named, fuel-based hybrid/PHEV filtering has known partial coverage — mention that to the user.
- Size and style qualifiers ("large SUV," "compact SUV," "sports sedan," "off-road capable," etc.) have no dedicated field — bodyType alone returns every size undifferentiated. Resolve these into a model list before searching (e.g. for "large SUV": "Suburban,Tahoe,Expedition,Sequoia,Wagoneer,Grand Wagoneer,Yukon XL,Yukon,Armada,Land Cruiser").
- Engine cylinder count IS a real, verified hard filter (cylinders) — this is a discrete count, distinct from engine displacement (e.g. "2.5L," "3.5L"), which is NOT filterable. "V8" means cylinders: 8. "V6" means cylinders: 6. "four-cylinder" or "I4" means cylinders: 4. If a user mentions a cylinder configuration, always map it to cylinders as a real filter — never treat it as an unfilterable displacement spec, and never fall back to checking each result's engine text by hand when the filter itself will do the job faster and more completely.

Map descriptive intent to the dedicated fields (bodyType, seatsMinPreference, goals) rather than into free-text model/trim strings. Prefer dedicated fields over model-list resolution whenever one exists — these are real, verified hard filters, not guesses: "AWD"/"4WD" → drivetrain. "Manual" → transmission. A named exterior color → exteriorColor. A named interior color → interiorColor. "V8"/"V6"/a cylinder count → cylinders (see the worked example above). A specific door count → doors. "Crossover" vs. "SUV," "hatchback" vs. "coupe," or any distinction finer than body type → vehicleType. Set priceFlexibility to "flexible" only if the user signals approximation ("around," "roughly," "about") — otherwise price stays a hard ceiling, never silently loosened.

History, ownership, and certification claims are disclosed, never used to exclude a result. "No accidents"/"one owner"/"CPO"/"certified pre-owned" map to noAccidents/oneOwner/cpo, but vehicle history and CPO status are frequently unreported or unconfirmed in the underlying data (roughly half of listings for history) — none of these ever exclude a result, and CPO status specifically can never be disproven by the data, only confirmed when present. Every result is checked against whatever data is actually available and honestly labeled: reported clean/certified, reported with issues, or unreported/unconfirmed. A Carfax link is included when available so the user can independently verify. If a result doesn't clearly confirm what was asked, say so plainly rather than presenting it as if it matched cleanly.

Set priorityAxis based on what the user is actually optimizing for, not just which fields happen to be filled in — the same request text can imply different priorities even with identical filters. "Best SUV I can get under $60k," "nicest one in my budget," or any request with a price ceiling and no other stated priority → "best_for_budget" (default — this samples from the top of the stated budget down, which tends to surface newer years and better trims). "Cheapest," "lowest price," "budget option" → "cheapest". "Lowest mileage," "as few miles as possible" → "lowest_mileage". "Newest," "latest model year" → "newest". When in doubt, use "best_for_budget" — it matches this tool's purpose of finding the best match, not just any match.`;

 *
 * This exists because inferring priority from *which fields happen to be set*
 * is genuinely ambiguous — a user with both priceMax and mileageMax could mean
 * "SUV under $60k, low mileage is a nice-to-have" or "lowest mileage SUV,
 * $60k is just a cap" - identical structured params, opposite intent. Only the
 * sentence itself disambiguates that, so it's the LLM's job, not a heuristic.
 *
 * best_for_budget (default) reflects the app's actual purpose: find the best
 * vehicle for what they're describing, not the cheapest one that qualifies.
 * Sampling from the top of a stated budget (price.desc) tends to correlate
 * with newer years/better trims — without us having to encode that correlation
 * ourselves. Falls back to year.desc when there's no price ceiling to anchor to.
